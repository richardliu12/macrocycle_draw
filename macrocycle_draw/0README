        This subdirectory contains compressed 64-bit TINKER executables
        for Intel-compatible machines running under Windows XP or later.
        The files can be expanded to .EXE files using any of the common
        ZIP compression/expansion utilities. Each executable is provided
        as a separate ZIP'd file. The programs were built using the Intel
        Fortran for Windows compiler. The libiomp5md.dll dynamic library
        is required by the executables and should be kept in the same
        location as the .EXE files. These executables can be run from the
        command line within a Command Prompt window or via the Cygwin
        shell, and will not work with the Force Field Explorer TINKER
        interface.

        Please note that in order to use the TINKER package, other files
        are required. In particular, force field parameter sets, examples
        and test cases, and documentation can be found as part of the full
        distribution on http://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/. Source code is
        also provided in case you want to build a customized version.

        These TINKER executables are dimensioned for 100000 atoms maximum.
        Other, more restrictive, limits apply to certain memory intensive
        programs. The limits have been increased at the request of many
        users. Since TINKER is written in static allocated Fortran and
        makes no attempt to manage its own memory usage, your computer
        must make available at startup all the memory or virtual memory
        the TINKER programs might eventually require. Instructions for
        changing the virtual memory size on most versions of Windows are
        readily available on the Internet.

        If larger or smaller versions of the executables are desired, it
        is straightforward to change the master dimensions in the "sizes.i"
        source file and build your own set of executables using the GNU
        g95 compiler or a commercial Fortran compiler such as Intel, PGI,
        Absoft or Lahey.
